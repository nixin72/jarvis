Just making this project for fun, named it Jarvis for lack of a better name.

I did a workshop on Machine Learning and didn't really get anywhere with it, so I decided I want to try messing around with making something. 

Uses the SpeechRecognition library for speech to text. Have not started including anything for natural language processing. 

This is my first full project in Python, so hopefully it'll work. Right now it doesn't do a whole lot though.
